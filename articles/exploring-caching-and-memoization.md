# Supercharging Your Applications with `midl`: Exploring Caching and Memoization

In the world of software development, optimizing performance and efficiency is a constant endeavor. One effective way to
achieve this is through the use of caching and memoization techniques. By remembering the result of an expensive
function and reusing the previously computed result when the same inputs occur, we can reduce time complexity and
improve performance.

Enter `midl`, a powerful middleware library that not only handles additional tasks like logging and validating inputs
and outputs but also allows you to implement caching and memoization seamlessly. In this blog post, we'll walk you
through how `midl` can be used to create caching and memoization mechanisms with examples.

## Understanding `midl`

`midl` is a versatile library that allows developers to wrap functions with additional functionality, often known as
middleware. This can include tasks such as logging, error handling, input/output validation, and more. Here is an
overview of `midl`:

```javascript
import {createFunctionWithMiddleware as midl} from 'midl';

const handleInput = (definition, a, b) => {
	if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
		throw new Error('Inputs must be numbers');
	}
	return [a, b];
};

const handleOutput = (definition, output, a, b) => {
	console.log(`Adding ${a} and ${b} yields ${output}`);
	return output;
};

let add = (a, b) => a + b;

add = midl(add, {
	handleInput: validateInput,
	handleOutput: logOutput,
});
```

The above code illustrates how you can simplify a function's core responsibilities using `midl`, handling the extra
tasks through middleware.

## Caching with `midl`

Caching involves storing the result of an expensive function and reusing that stored result when the same inputs are
provided. This can drastically speed up our applications by avoiding repeated calculations. Here's an example of how we
can implement a simple caching mechanism using `midl`.

```javascript
import {createFunctionWithMiddleware as midl} from 'midl';

// Middleware to handle caching
const cache = {};
const handleInput = (definition, ...args) => {
	const key = JSON.stringify(args);
	if (key in cache) {
		return cache[key];
	}

	const result = definition(...args);
	cache[key] = result;
	return result;
};

// Fibonacci sequence calculation is a good example of a costly function
const fibonacci = (n) => {
	if (n <= 1) return n;
	return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};

// Enhancing Fibonacci with caching middleware
const cachedFibonacci = midl(fibonacci, {handleInput});

console.log(cachedFibonacci(50)); // This computation is now much faster with caching
```

In the above example, a caching mechanism was implemented as middleware for the Fibonacci sequence calculation.
The `handleInput` middleware function checks if the result for the given input already exists in the cache, and if so,
it returns the cached result, bypassing the function's execution. If not, it executes the function and stores the result
in the cache for future use.

## Memoization with `midl`

Memoization is a specific form of caching where the cached results are stored within the function itself. Here's how you
can implement memoization with `midl`.

```javascript
import {createFunctionWithMiddleware as midl} from 'midl';

// Middleware to handle memoization
const handleInput = (definition, ...args) => {
	if (!definition.cache) {
		definition.cache = {};
	}

	const key = JSON.stringify(args);
	if (key in definition.cache) {
		return definition.cache[key];
	}

	const result = definition(...args);
	definition.cache[key] = result;
	return result;
};

const fibonacci = (n) => {
	if (n <= 1) return n;
	return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};

// Enhancing Fibonacci with memoization middleware
const memoizedFibonacci = midl(fibonacci, {handleInput});

console.log(memoizedFibonacci(50)); // This computation is now much faster with memoization
```

In the example above, the `handleInput` middleware function checks if the result for the given input is already memoized
within the function's cache. If it is, it simply returns the memoized result, otherwise, it executes the function and
memoizes the result within the function for future use.

## Conclusion

By taking advantage of the flexibility provided by `midl`, we can easily implement powerful strategies like caching and
memoization in our functions. Not only does this improve our application's performance, but it also ensures our code
remains clean, efficient, and easy to maintain.

In essence, `midl` is a valuable addition to any developer's toolbelt, making it easier to build robust, efficient, and
maintainable software. So, don't wait, supercharge your applications with `midl` today!
