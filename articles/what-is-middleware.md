# What is Middleware?

Let's start with a metaphor. Imagine you're a mail carrier. Your job is to deliver letters from the post office to
people's homes. Simple, right? Now, what if your boss tells you to also sort the letters by neighborhood, double-check
the addresses for mistakes, and time-stamp each delivery? Suddenly, your once straightforward job has gotten a lot more
complex.

This is similar to what happens in software development. Functions, the building blocks of programming, often get
burdened with additional responsibilities, which can make them complex and hard to manage.

Just like our mail carrier, functions would much prefer to focus on their main job. But how can we handle these extra
tasks without overloading our functions? The answer is Middleware.

## The Middleware Magic

Back to our mail carrier example. What if, instead of doing all those extra tasks alone, you had a helper? Someone who
sorts the mail at the post office (before you start your route), a team who verifies addresses (so you only get correct
ones), and a device that automatically time-stamps your deliveries. Suddenly, your job is simple again. You just deliver
the mail.

In programming, middleware is like those helpers and devices for your functions. Middleware handles extra
responsibilities, freeing the function to focus on its main task.

Consider a function that adds two numbers. Alongside addition, it also checks if inputs are numbers and logs the result.
With middleware, we can have separate functions to validate inputs and log the result, while our original function
simply adds the numbers. The code becomes more organized and easier to maintain.

## Welcome `midl`

`midl` is a library that allows you to easily apply middleware to your functions. You can validate inputs, handle
outputs, or manage errors without complicating your core function logic.

For instance, you might have a function to divide two numbers. Without middleware, you would need to include code to
check if the denominator is zero to avoid division by zero error. However, with `midl`, you can have middleware that
checks this condition before the function runs and handles the error, making the divide function simple and clean.

Remember, just like having helpers makes the mail carrier's job easier, using middleware like `midl` can make your
programming tasks less complex and more enjoyable. Let middleware handle the extras, while your functions focus on their
core jobs.

Embrace the power of middleware and enjoy the simplicity it brings to your code!
