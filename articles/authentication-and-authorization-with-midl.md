# Authentication and Authorization with `midl`

## Introduction

Today, we'll explore how `midl`, a custom middleware library, can help control access to your functions in various
scenarios, including authentication and authorization. Middleware libraries are critical for handling requests and
responses within a software system, and they significantly contribute to reducing complexity and improving the
reusability of code. By the end of this post, you'll understand how `midl` can be used to protect your functions and add
another layer of security to your applications.

## Authentication with `midl`

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. It's crucial to ensure that the
requester is who they claim to be before granting them access to resources. Let's see how `midl` can be employed in an
authentication scenario.

```javascript
import {createFunctionWithMiddleware as midl} from 'midl';

const authenticate = (definition, token) => {
	if (!isValidToken(token)) {
		throw new Error('Invalid token');
	}
	return [token];
};

const getProfile = midl(
	(token) => {
		// fetch user profile using the token
		const profile = fetchUserProfile(token);
		return profile;
	},
	{handleInput: authenticate}
);

console.log(getProfile('validToken123')); // Retrieves the user profile
console.log(getProfile('invalidToken456')); // Throws an error: Invalid token
```

In this example, we use `midl` to authenticate requests to fetch a user's profile. Before the `getProfile` function
executes, the `authenticate` middleware verifies the token. If the token is invalid, an error is thrown and the function
execution stops.

## Authorization with `midl`

Authorization is the process of verifying if an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform a certain
action. It ensures that a user doesn't access resources they're not allowed to. Let's see how `midl` can help with this.

```javascript
import {createFunctionWithMiddleware as midl} from 'midl';

const authorize = (definition, user, resource) => {
	if (!hasAccess(user, resource)) {
		throw new Error('Access denied');
	}
	return [user, resource];
};

const accessResource = midl(
	(user, resource) => {
		// User can access the resource
		return `User ${user.id} accessed resource ${resource.id}`;
	},
	{handleInput: authorize}
);

console.log(accessResource(user1, resourceA)); // Access is granted if user1 has access to resourceA
console.log(accessResource(user2, resourceB)); // Throws an error: Access denied if user2 doesn't have access to resourceB
```

In this example, the `authorize` middleware checks if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the
requested resource. If the user lacks the required permissions, the middleware throws an error, effectively stopping the
function execution.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the `midl` middleware library, you can effectively control access to your functions. Middleware provides
an efficient way to intercept and manage requests and responses, ensuring that functions only run after necessary
preconditions (such as authentication and authorization) are met. As shown in the examples, `midl` provides an intuitive
and powerful framework to apply these controls. When utilized correctly, it can significantly improve the security and
robustness of your application.
